  </p>
  
  <p>
    Personal data is typically encrypted during transmission between your device and our systems to protect against unauthorized access. However, if you communicate with us via email or through internet service providers, third-party access cannot be entirely ruled out. We ensure that all personal information is encrypted both in transit and at rest to maintain its confidentiality and integrity.
