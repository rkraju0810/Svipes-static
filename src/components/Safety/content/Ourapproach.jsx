                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    We&#39;re all about creating a safe, fun, and inclusive space for everyone to connect and express themselves. Our community guidelines are here to help make that happen. By using Svipes, you&#39;re agreeing to play by these rules:                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>1. Be Kind, Not Mean.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    We&#39;re here to lift each other up, not tear each other down. Any form of bullying, harassment, or shaming isn&#39;t cool and won&#39;t be tolerated. Treat everyone with respect, both on and off the app.                    </p>
                   
                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>2. Respect Privacy.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    Keep it private. Don&#39;t share anyone&#39;s personal information—like their phone number, address, or any other details—without their consent. Respect boundaries.</p>
                    
                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>3. Spread love, not hate.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    Discrimination has no place here. We don&#39;t allow hate speech of any kind, including attacks on someone&#39;s race, gender, sexuality, religion, body type, or abilities. Everyone deserves to feel safe and welcome.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>4. Keep it real, not fake.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    Honesty is the best policy. Don&#39;t spread fake news, misinformation, or conspiracy theories. If it&#39;s not true or you&#39;re not sure, don&#39;t post it. Let&#39;s keep the vibe positive and factual.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>5. Post thoughtfully; avoid explicit content.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    We&#39;re all about self-expression, but let&#39;s keep it appropriate. Avoid posting overly explicit, sexual, or violent content. If it&#39;s graphic or could make others uncomfortable, it&#39;s best to share it elsewhere. Let&#39;s keep things light and fun here.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>6. No spamming, please.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    Quality over quantity. Don&#39;t flood the feed with repetitive or unnecessary content. Share what matters, and keep it interesting.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>7. Follow the law.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    If it&#39;s illegal, it&#39;s not allowed here. Don&#39;t use [App Name] to promote or engage in any illegal activities. We&#39;re here to have fun, not break the law.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>8. 3 Strikes, and You're Out.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    We believe in second chances, but repeated rule-breaking won&#39;t fly. After three community violations, your account may be permanently suspended. Let&#39;s keep the community positive and respectful.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-3xl'>9. Report and support.</h3>
                    <p className='w-full h-full'>
                    If you see something, say something. Use our reporting tools to flag any content that violates these guidelines. We&#39;re all in this together, so let&#39;s help each other out.</p>
